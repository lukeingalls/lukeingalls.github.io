          This is a 2005 Toyota Camry. It was originally my Dad&apos;s and was
          used by me and my brothers off and on during high school.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It met it&apos;s end at my hands. I was driving home from work on
          Parker road and came across a buckle in the road. I tried to stop but
          couldn&apos;t get the car to slow down fast enough ended up hitting
          the car in front of me.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The lady I hit was super nice. I totally rear end her again. As we
          waited for emergency responders to help, another rear end accident
          happened. I felt slightly vindicated because even with the visual sign
          of a previous crash before the road buckle, this dude still started
          another accident.
        </p>

          Unfortunately for him, he had a suspended license and was arrested. I
          got off with just a ticket.

          I spent all of the money I earned from working at the golf course to
          buy this EOS. It was fun having a convertible -- especially a hard top
          one. It ended up being one of my favorite past times in high school. I
          would just drive around and enjoy the car. My favorite areas were near
          Elizabeth especially on Delbert road.
        </p>
        <br />

          Unfortunately, I ended up losing this car to a hail storm. I was
          driving home from my golf maintanence job and it just started hailing
          on me. I would really not recommend driving through hail like that. I
          was watching the windsheild flex and just hoping that it the hail
          wouldn&apos;t break all the way through that or the moonroof.
          Fortunately, the hail let up pretty quick but the damage done to the
          car exceeded it&apos;s value so the insurance company totalled it out.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          That ended up being a bit of a blessing. I ended up putting all that
          money toward tuition during college. I would&apos;ve enjoyed having
          that car but I think the stress of car expenses wouldn&apos;t have
          been great for me (and I probably wouldn&apos;t have elected to sell
          it otherwise).

          I was graduated from Chaparral High School in 2018. I was #10 in the
          class of 2018.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          While at Chaparral I was on the robotics team all 4 years and led it
          in my Senior year. Over that time, we won our division twice and
          competed at the regional competition in Arkansas after each of those
          wins.
