          This is a 2005 Toyota Camry. It was originally my Dad&apos;s and was
          used by me and my brothers off and on during high school.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It met it&apos;s end at my hands. I was driving home from work on
          Parker road and came across a buckle in the road. I tried to stop but
          couldn&apos;t get the car to slow down fast enough ended up hitting
          the car in front of me.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The lady I hit was super nice. I totally rear end her again. As we
          waited for emergency responders to help, another rear end accident
          happened. I felt slightly vindicated because even with the visual sign
          of a previous crash before the road buckle, this dude still started
          another accident.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Unfortunately for him, he had a suspended license and was arrested. I
          got off with just a ticket.

          I spent all of the money I earned from working at the golf course to
          buy this EOS. It was fun having a convertible -- especially a hard top
          one. It ended up being one of my favorite past times in high school. I
          would just drive around and enjoy the car. My favorite areas were near
          Elizabeth especially on Delbert road.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Unfortunately, I ended up losing this car to a hail storm. I was
          driving home from my golf maintanence job and it just started hailing
          on me. I would really not recommend driving through hail like that. I
          was watching the windsheild flex and just hoping that it the hail
          wouldn&apos;t break all the way through that or the moonroof.
          Fortunately, the hail let up pretty quick but the damage done to the
          car exceeded it&apos;s value so the insurance company totalled it out.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          That ended up being a bit of a blessing. I ended up putting all that
          money toward tuition during college. I would&apos;ve enjoyed having
          that car but I think the stress of car expenses wouldn&apos;t have
          been great for me (and I probably wouldn&apos;t have elected to sell
          it otherwise).

          I was graduated from Chaparral High School in 2018. I was #10 in the
          class of 2018.

        <p>
          While at Chaparral I was on the robotics team all 4 years and led it
          in my Senior year. Over that time, we won our division twice and
          competed at the regional competition in Arkansas after each of those
          wins.

          College was an interesting experience for me. It was an unusual
          experience be cause COVID hit 1.5 years into it and I also graduated a
          year early.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In retrospect, I was too focused on the financial side of college. I
          didn&apos;t want to take any loans out and so I focused almost
          entirely on education. Anything that cost money I avoided and so I
          didn&apos;t get much of an advantage in terms of networking (and it
          heavily influenced my decision to stay in state).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          While I was there, I was a course assistant for Algorithms, Operating
          Systems, and Software Development Methods. This meant I held office
          hours to tutor other undergraduates on the coursework. Most of this
          was done remotely during COVID.

          I loved this job. I worked at both Aurora Hills and Saddle Rock golf
          courses in Aurora, CO. It built some good habits like waking up early
          and I also thought it was fun driving all the equipment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          There was typical work annoyances but overall working outside on
          machinery was great. I also got exposed to golf through this. I
          initially played because it was a free benefit but I grew to enjoy it.
          I also really liked playing the country clubs with my bosses since
          they could get us on for free.

          Cane&apos;s is still probably my favorite fast food restaurant. I
          applied there before knowing what it was. We just saw the signs that a
          new chicken place was going in and I wanted a job during the school
          year. I still worked some weekends at the golf course but this was
          supposed to be more regular.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the end, this was a terrible fit. They continued to schedule me
          closing shifts (which could go till 2am) and that made it difficult to
          balance with school. I also learned a good lesson about pay here. I
          was making pretty much the least there because I hadn&apos;t
          negotiated at all. It was frustrating making $2 less an hour than
          other people in the same position.

          I did like the legal curfew exception. Going to McDonalds or Walmart
          that late riding around in my convertabile are fond memories.

          This was my first developer experience. I was working on Schwab&apos;s
          design system. They were using Angular and StencilJS to build their
          internal component system and I supported this initiative.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          I learned best practices in component-based architecture as well as
          some of the nitty-gritty of CSS. This was a remote internship during
          COVID. I&apos;m still really thankful to Schwab for continuing the
          program given the uncertainty. I also found their internal culture to
          be sincere and continue to hold my money there to this day.

          Kapwing is my first full-time software engineeing experinece.
          It&apos;s hard to sum up this experience because I&apos;ve done so
          much there.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I started while I was still finishing the last semester of College as
          a Junior engineer. By the summer, I got promoted to an L4 engineer. At
          the time of writing this, I&apos;m an L6 staff engineer and have
          worked on the entire stack there.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My biggest accomplishments have been shipping large AI features as
          well as making improvements to the performance and reliablity of the
          app. For about 2 years, I was managing teams in both of these areas
          (and peaked at 6 reports). We shipped the dubbing tool and scaled
          performance capabilities by 100x.
